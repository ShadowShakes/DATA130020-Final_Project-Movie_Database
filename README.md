# DATA130020-Movie_Database
This project is the final term project of course "DATA130020: Database and Implementation" at School of Data Science, Fudan University (2020 Spring). 

This interactive database is finished by Shaohan Chen, Yuxuan Zhao, Yuanzhu Zhan, Zhongyang Wang.

The project is conducted in Python using PYQT5 and Qtdesigner (completed by Shaohan Chen) as well as some functions that connects the SQL Server to Python (completed by Yuxuan Zhao and Yuanzhu Zhan). It makes a movie database with data collected from Douban after some modifications (completed by Zhongyang Wang). 

To design and conduct such a project, you may need to install and learn how to use PYQT5 and Qtdesigner, since they are the necessary ingredients to make interacive interfaces in Python. Besides, you need to learn how to connect to SQL Server in python. Some tutorials and instructions on CSDN will help you learn PYQT5 more quickly.

Note that according to the latest information, this course is no longer using SQL Server 2008 but MySQL instead, so the way of connecting to database may differ from our version here.
